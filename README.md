# dialog_themes
This is my repository of themes for dialog (for Linux).<br>

<br>
Linux Dialog uses a set of predefined colors based on ANSI color codes. The standard colors are:<br>
  Color Number -- Color Name<br>
      0--             BLACK<br>
      1--             RED<br>
      2--             GREEN<br>
      3--             YELLOW<br>
      4--             BLUE<br>
      5--             MAGENTA<br>
      6--             CYAN<br>
      7--             WHITE<br>
<br>
These can be used to replace your .dialogrc, or you can `call` them by setting the DIALOGRC environment variable:<br>
    export DIALOGRC=/path/to/your/custom/.dialogrc_custom_theme_name<br>
<br>
<b>.dialogrc_whiptail</b> = Even though dialog and whiptail are very similar, they are not the same. This theme is my best attempt to replicate the default colors/theme of whiptail.<br>
<b>.dialogrc_monochrome</b> = This is my first `unique` theme, it is a GREEN MONOCHROME theme for dialog.<br>
<b>.dialogrc_cyan</b> = I did not make this theme, credit goes to https://cp737.net/blog/cyan-theme-for-dialog-rc<br>
