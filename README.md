# dialog_themes
This is my repository of themes for dialog (for Linux).
    -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialog_(software)

Linux Dialog uses a set of predefined colors based on ANSI color codes. The standard colors are:
  Color Number    Color Name
      0             BLACK
      1             RED
      2             GREEN
      3             YELLOW
      4             BLUE
      5             MAGENTA
      6             CYAN
      7             WHITE

These can be used to replace your .dialogrc, or you can `call` them by setting the DIALOGRC environment variable:
    export DIALOGRC=/path/to/your/custom/.dialogrc_custom_theme_name

.dialogrc_whiptail = Even though dialog and whiptail are very similar, they are not the same. This theme is my best attempt to replicate the default colors/theme of whiptail.
.dialogrc_monochrome = This is my first `unique` theme, it is a GREEN MONOCHROME theme for dialog.
.dialogrc_cyan = I did not make this theme, credit goes to https://cp737.net/blog/cyan-theme-for-dialog-rc
